"""
Phase 3 — Black-box functional tests for Neo4j recommendations.

Tests verify the co-purchase recommendation engine built from historical_orders.json:
  - get_recommendations returns correctly shaped, sorted, filtered results
  - create_order updates the Neo4j graph with new co-purchase edges

All tests use the full `db` fixture (Postgres + MongoDB + Redis + Neo4j).
Tests that need baseline data use the `seeded` fixture.
